The sun was shinning brightly, and the birds were chirpping merrily as Sarah stepped outside.
 She was excited to meat her friends at the park, where they planned to have a picnick. 
 However, she quickly realized she had forgotton to bring the blanket. 
 Rushing back inside, she trippped over her cat, who was lounging lazilly on the rug.
 After apologising to the startled pet, Sarah grabbed the blanket and hurried off, hoping she wouldnâ€™t be too late.
